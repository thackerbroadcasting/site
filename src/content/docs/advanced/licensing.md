Music licensing can be complicated. You're not sure if you even need a license for what you're trying to accomplish. That's where we come in.

Serving as the middle-man between your business and the complex inner workings of the music industry, we're able to get you the license you need to operate properly and fully legally.

Now you might be asking, isn't playing Spotify from that iPad in the back sufficient? If your goal is to simply play music, sure. However, you open you business up to a lot of legal gray areas when you do. While most customers won't bat an eye, other more keen observers may, especially if they wish anything but success for your business.
