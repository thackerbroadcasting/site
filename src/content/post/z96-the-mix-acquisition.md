FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

In a recent deal made between Z96 The Mix and Thacker Broadcasting, Z96 has agreed to become an asset of Thacker Broadcasting. This deal was made in light of both companies being managed separately by the same staff. Thus, it made sense to bring Z96 into the Thacker Broadcasting family.

Welcome Z96 The Mix!
